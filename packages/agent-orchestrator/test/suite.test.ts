/**
 * The root's `npm test` runs every package to its end.
 *
 * Turbo's default, `--continue=never`, interrupts every task still running when one fails, and `node --test`
 * reports each file it was in the middle of as failed — `✖ test/detached.test.ts`, *Promise resolution is still
 * pending but the event loop has already resolved*, with no failing test inside it. The package that failed is named
 * only on the summary's `Failed:` line, so a person reads the longest file of another package as the failure: three
 * checks did, blaming `detached.test.ts` for a flaky assertion in `meter-store.test.ts` and a real one in the api.
